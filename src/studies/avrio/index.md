<h2 class="h2">Project Overview</h2>

<p class="body">I interned at Avrio AI, an AI human resources startup, as the sole front-end engineer and designer. I worked closely with the Marketing Lead to develop a corporate visual identity and to expand this to their marketing website hosted on the HubSpot CMS. I added an integration with an AI chatbot onto the site, increasing leads while decreasing the bounce rate.</p>

##The Competitors
<h3 class="doubleHeader">The Prompt</h3>
<p class="body">Before designing, I performed market research into Avrio's competitors, analyzing the content, design, and user experience of their marketing websites. We wanted to be within the competition, yet still unique.</p>

###The Issues
<p class="body">The website was outdated and did not reflect the pivot that Avrio was making. Information architecture, given the concerns that AI would take thejobs of others, we wanted to design an interface that was welcoming and that users could trust.</p>

###Mockup and Style Guide
<p class="body">During the wireframe hand-off process, the product side of our team had difficulty with naming conventions and making our code as clear and concise as could be. To solve this issue, I led a meeting with all members of our team to establish a common vocabulary</p>

<p class="body">I also created a style and branding guide to assist the engineers with the development of our site. Before the launch of our MVP, and subsequent update releases, I did a front-end style pass through the website to ensure consistency across all devices.</p>

##Inbound Marketing
<h3 class="doubleHeader">Ad Strategy</h3>
<p class="body">After our MVP went live, we launched a series of Facebook advertisements to drive traffic to our website and to gather feedback on user interaction. We were instructed to use Facebook and Instagram ads as our only source of paid traffic, with a budget of $7500 for 10 weeks. Working with the analysts, we designed various advertisements and A/B tests to improve our link conversions and the CPC of our ads. After running A/B tests, we found that the best ads featured images of women, had minimal text, and ran on Facebook only, rather than both Instagram and Facebook.</p>

<h2 class="afterImg">Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3 class="doubleHeader">Get Thrifty</h3>
<p class="body">While there were beautiful, my manager expressed that she would prefer not to spend money on a theme. She also wanted to stay within the HubSpot ecosystem to continue tracking analytics on Avrio's website traction and inbound marketing campaigns. While I was unfamiliar with the HubSpot platform, especially with designing a theme for hubspot, I quickly found an online course to guide me through the process. While the platform was unintuive and difficult to develop upon, I evntually brought my designs into life.</p>

###Be Flexible
<p class="body">The most important lesson I've learned at a startup is to be flexible with your skills, your time, and your comfort zone. While I was a designer and front-end engineer, I also had to colla</p>

###Facebook Ads
<p class="body">Based on Facebook's algorithm, advertisements work best with high relevance scores and long-running lifetimes. If we were to redo this project, we would focus on a few ads and run them for the duration of the 10 weeks.</p>

###Data and Design
<p class="body">The most important lesson for me was how powerful data can be when applied in the design process. Including quantitative data into the design process allowed me to not have to make assumptions about the user. The qualitative feedback from user testing was also much more informative because I looked to the data from A/B tests first, and asked users to explain the same qualitatively.</p>
