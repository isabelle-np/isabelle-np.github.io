<h2 class="h2">Project Overview</h2>

<p class="body">I interned at Avrio AI, an AI human resources startup, as a front-end engineer and UI designer. I worked closely with the Marketing Lead to develop a corporate visual identity and to expand this to their marketing website hosted on the HubSpot CRM.</p>

##Define

<h3 class="doubleHeader">The Company</h3>
<p class="body">Avrio's product utilizes artificial intelligence to screen applicants by analyzing their resumes against the job description and perfoming an initial screening with a chat bot. Before designing the company website, I performed market research into Avrio's competitors, analyzing the content, design, and user experience of their sites. We wanted the new look of Avrio to fall within the same realm, yet stand out amongst the competition.</p>


###The Issues
<p class="body">The old website was outdated and did not reflect the pivot that Avrio was making. Key components of the redesign included shifting the narrative of the company to a modern tech company, explaining the product in a clear and concise manner, and increasing leads to sales. Given the concerns that the product was changing the role of a recruiter, we wanted to design an interface that was welcoming and trusting.</p>


##Design and Development
<p class="body">After my research and ideating with the Marketing Lead, I developed wireframes and mockups, presenting my work weekly to upper management. Because I was developing on top of a CRM platform that was not developer-friendly, I had to design around the constraints of HubSpot's software. As I was building a theme from scratch, there was little documentation I could refer to, nor an active community I could reach out to. In order to meet my deadlines, I had to be creative with HubSpot modules and layouts to build a clean, responsive website.</p>

<h2 class="afterImg">Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3 class="doubleHeader">Get Thrifty</h3>
<p class="body">While HubSpot had a collection of fully responsive, premium themes, my manager expressed that she would prefer not to spend the money on a theme. She also wanted to stay within the HubSpot ecosystem to continue tracking analytics on Avrio's website traction and inbound marketing campaigns. While the platform was unintuive and difficult to develop upon, I creatively manuvered around the software's constraints and delivered the final product in time for a large technology conference.</p>

###Be Flexible
<p class="body">Working in a start-up, I had to leverage all of my skills and experiences. While I was responsible for delivering the company website, I also assisted in product design, marketing campaigns, event planning, photography and videography.</p>
